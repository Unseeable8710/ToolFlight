Check the wiki for all ToolFlight documentation. The wiki covers all possible topics[^1] about ToolFlight, including how to install it, how to use it, its features, and tips.

## Installation


## Additional information
### Notes
This project is incomplete, so this README doesn't have all the information and neither does the wiki.

### Credits
I don't have anyone to credit here yet, but I assure you this will be the longest thing in the README by the time I get the first testing release published.

[^1]: The wiki is currently nonexistent.
