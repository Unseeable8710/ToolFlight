## Additional information
### Changelog
The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/Unseeable8710/ToolFlight/wiki/Changelog) in the wiki.

### Notes
This project is incomplete, so this README doesn't have all the information and neither does the wiki.

### Credits
I don't have anyone to credit here yet, but I assure you this will be the longest thing in the README by the time I get the first testing release published.

[^1]: The wiki currently does *not* contain all possible topics about ToolFlight.
